Rules for developing on the PEM codebase

1. The platform:
PEM is a site to find jobs in Albanian Regions (Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia and beyond)
The site primary language is Albanian
In this site, users can sign up using Oauth2 or Email and search for jobs and apply
There is a built in chatting system use to communicate with employers in different jobs
Companies can also register on their own, but an admin has to approve them

2. Coding style:

Commenting Rules:
- Avoid overusing comments
- Avoid using comments when the code is readable and usable just fine
- Keep comments clean and concise

3. Coding Rules:

Backend rules:
- Always use Typescript
- Use JWT-based authentication (there is a requireUser util for this) instead of getServerSession
- Always make sure your code is secure and has no logical mistakes

Frontend rules:
- Font Montserrat is the primary font (with font-medium font weight)
- Use DaisyUI buttons where possible (Primary, Danger, etc. But dont forget to add rounded-sm or rounded-md since daisyui default rounding is broken)
- Keep a consistent style similar to the rest of the site
- Avoid massive components (400+ lines), split components if that's the best solution
